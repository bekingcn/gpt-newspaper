Read more: Swiss Aim to Host Conference on Ukraine Peace Plan Mid-June Putin and Xi are set to meet at a regional summit in Kazakhstan in June and in October at a leaders’ meeting of the BRICS emerging economies’ bloc, Lavrov said. “China supports the holding in due course of an international peace conference that is recognized by both sides — of Russia and Ukraine — and ensures the equal participation of all parties and fair discussions on all peace plans,” she said.  Lavrov added that Wang proposed the idea of “double counteracting” the US and its allies in response to the “double deterrence” of Western countries against Russia and China.  China on Monday said it hasn’t sought to benefit from Russia’s war in Ukraine after the US warned allies that Beijing has stepped up its support for Moscow, including by providing geospatial intelligence, to help it in its invasion of the neighboring ex-Soviet state.

Mass use of guided bombs driving Russian advances, says Ukraine Up to 500 ‘drop-and-forget’ bombs containing foreign components being fired every week, government says The mass use of “drop-and-forget” guided bombs containing foreign components is driving Russian advances in Ukraine, with up to 500 now being fired a week, according to a Ukrainian government analysis.  According to a Ukrainian government report obtained by the Guardian, such weapons fired from afar by aircraft “played a key role in the destruction of [the eastern city of] Avdiivka and the seizure of its ruins by Russia”.  The bombs – ranging from the 250kg FAB-250 to the 1,500kg FAB-1500s – on which the guidance systems are often attached, are high explosive and have a “relatively robust casing for penetrating soil or obstacles such as interfloor floors of buildings and structures”, according to the Ukrainian report.

Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukraine says its air force has downed drones and guided missiles launched by Russia Air force commander says 14 of 17 attack drones and two guided missiles targeting Odesa and Mykolaiv region were destroyed Live feed An EU court has removed war-related sanctions against prominent billionaires Petr Aven and Mikhail Fridman, in a surprise victory for the Russian oligarchs in their fight against western sanctions.  The EU council announcing the sanctions in February 2022 called Aven “one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs” and stated that Fridman “has managed to cultivate strong ties to the administration of Vladimir Putin, and has been referred to as a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle”.  A drone has attacked the city of Taganrog in the Rostov region of southern Russia, the head of the city administration Andrei Fateyev has said via his channel on the Telegram messaging app.  Both men have given only guarded criticism of Putin’s war in Ukraine, with Fridman saying in the early weeks of the conflict that it was a “tragedy” and that war “can never be the answer”.

            "content": "Within weeks, Russia will be able to launch 10 artillery shells for every one round fired by Ukraine without additional U.S. aid, Gen. Christopher Cavoli said The top U.S. general overseeing military operations in Europe warned lawmakers Wednesday that the war in Ukraine has reached a decisive moment, with Russia expected to hold a 10-1 advantage on artillery shells “within weeks” unless the United States approves additional military support for the government in Kyiv.  What to know about Ukraine’s counteroffensive The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.  Others have said they foresee an array of grim possibilities if the aid is not approved, including the likelihood of massive Ukrainian casualties in the best-case scenario and a collapse of Ukrainian front lines in the worst.  The fight: Ukrainian troops have intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.  The stark assessment came as House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has refused to hold a vote on a national security spending package that includes about $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, and additional money for Pacific initiatives and other priorities.
